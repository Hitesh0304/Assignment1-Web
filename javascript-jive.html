    	   <!-- 2.) use javascript to dynamically create content for the paragraph and h2 elements -->
    	   <p class="hidden">If you place your Javascript file in the head tag, it won't load the remaining content i.e. body tag until it finishes the script files. It also execute the javascript  even before DOM is ready.So, it would be good to include javascript at the bottom of an html page than in the head </p>
